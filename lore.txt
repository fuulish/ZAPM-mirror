brain bug
 "Insects with intelligence?!!  Have you ever met one?
 I can't believe I am hearing this nonsense.  This is 
 the most ridiculous conversation I have ever..."

 "Would you just wait a minute!!  (expletive deleted) 
 Maybe there is some kind of bug that we haven't seen
 yet, a leadership caste, a hive brain..."

 "Brain bug?!!!  Frankly I find the idea of a bug that
 thinks offensive!"
